# Mental Health Tracker App for Students Using LSTM

## Overview

The **Mental Health Tracker App** is designed to help students monitor and improve their mental health by providing personalized insights and suggestions. Using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), the app analyzes mood patterns and behavior over time to predict and manage mental health concerns effectively.

The app integrates data such as user inputs (survey responses, mood tracking, sleep patterns, etc.), environmental factors, and other relevant information to provide actionable recommendations, track progress, and offer real-time insights.

## Key Features
- **User Mood Tracking**: Log your mood on a daily or weekly basis to track emotional changes over time.
- **Survey and Self-Assessment**: Answer periodic surveys designed to evaluate mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, and stress.
- **Personalized Insights**: Receive personalized suggestions based on mood trends and behaviors.
- **Real-time Mood Prediction**: The app uses LSTM-based models to predict future mental health states and suggest appropriate interventions.
- **Progress Tracking**: Visualize progress with graphs and statistics, including mood trends, improvements, and areas needing attention.
- **Emergency Contacts**: Access emergency resources, helplines, and mental health professionals.
- **Secure Login**: Ensure privacy and security of student data with encrypted login features.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Vue for dynamic interactions)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask or Django) for API and processing
- **Model**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for mood prediction and analysis
- **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL for storing user data and progress
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login
- **Visualization**: Chart.js or D3.js for visualizing mental health data

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: The app collects mood logs, survey responses, and other inputs related to the user's mental health.
2. **LSTM Model**: The LSTM model is trained on historical data to identify patterns and trends in mood and behavior. It makes predictions about future emotional states.
3. **Personalized Suggestions**: Based on the analysis, the app offers personalized insights, suggesting relaxation exercises, mood boosters, or coping strategies.
4. **User Progress**: Over time, the app tracks and visualizes changes in the user's mental health, providing a comprehensive overview of their emotional wellbeing.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for frontend)
- Pip (for Python package management)

### Steps to Run:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mental-health-tracker-app.git
   cd mental-health-tracker-app
   ```

2. Install required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. Set up the backend:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory and run:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Model Training (LSTM)

1. The LSTM model is trained using historical data, including mood logs, behavioral responses, and environmental factors.
2. The model predicts future mood states by identifying temporal dependencies in the data.
3. To train the model, use the provided `train_model.py` script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory and can be loaded in the app for predictions.

## Future Improvements
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Integrate NLP techniques to analyze open-ended responses from users and provide deeper insights into their mental state.
- **Mobile Application**: Expand the app to mobile platforms (Android/iOS) for better accessibility.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Add real-time notifications and reminders for mental health tips, mood tracking, and assessments.
- **Integration with Wearables**: Integrate with devices like Fitbits, Apple Watches, or health apps to collect data on sleep patterns, heart rate, and physical activity.
- **Multi-language Support**: Support for multiple languages to accommodate a wider range of students.
